# Linux Installation Instructions

## AppImage

Download the AppImage and type the following:

1. `chmod +x marktext-%version%-x86_64.AppImage`
2. `./marktext-%version%-x86_64.AppImage`
3. Now you can execute Mark Text.

### Installation

You cannot really install an AppImage. It's just a file which can be integrated with your desktop environment. The only thing you have to do is to create a desktop file that link to Mark Text (like `~/.local/share/applications/appimage-marktext.desktop`).

##### System integration

You can integrate the AppImage into the system via AppImageLauncher.

### Uninstallation

1. Delete AppImage file.
2. Delete your desktop file if exists.
3. Delete your user settings: `~/.config/marktext`

### Custom launch script

1. Save AppImage somewhere. Let's say `~/bin/marktext.AppImage`
2. `chmod +x ~/bin/marktext.AppImage`
3. Create a launch script:
   ```sh
   #!/bin/bash
   DESKTOPINTEGRATION=0 ~/bin/marktext.AppImage
   ```

### Known issues

- Mark Text is always integrated into desktop environment after updating

## Binary
